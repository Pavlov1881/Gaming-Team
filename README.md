# Gaming-Team
**Gaming-Team** is a multipage application using MVC architecture for my JS Back-End course final exam preparation

## Introduction
The visitors can view the home page and All Games Code catalog with the available offers. They can also register with an email, username, and password, which will allow them to create their offers for game code and buy games (if the current user is not the owner of the game). Authors can edit or delete posts at any time.
The application provide **guests** (not logged-in users) with the functionality to **login**, **register**, and view the home page, the All Games Code page, and the details page.
The application should provide users (logged-in) with the functionality to:
•	view the home page and all the other pages with logged-in navigation;
•	view the All Games Code page;
•	create а new game offer (Create Game Offer);
•	access the game details pages (Details);
•	buy games (if the current user is not the owner of the offer);
•	delete or edit the offer depending on the user's authentication (only for the owner of the current game offer).
